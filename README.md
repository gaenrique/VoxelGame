## VoxelGame
A simple Voxel game made from scratch using OpenGL and CMake.

The goal of this project is to use the OpenGL knowledge I have gained from making the simple OpenGL Renderer and make a game. For this reason, I have chosen to make a Voxel 
game. A Voxel game has simple cube graphics, but will prove to be a good project to ensure I understand simple OpenGL concepts, and even learn new concepts such as
lighting and sky boxes. Furthermore, building a voxel game will also help me learn concepts such as terrain generation, chunks, etc.
